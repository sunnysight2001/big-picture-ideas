      "title": "The Core Insight",
      "content": "Most AI video tools fail because users treat video as a single prompt. Google Flow is different. It is designed around scenes, transitions, and narrative progression — which aligns naturally with how humans understand stories."

      "title": "What Makes Google Flow Different",
      "content": "Google Flow is not just another text-to-video generator. Its real strength lies in how it encourages creators to define mood, camera movement, lighting, and visual continuity across scenes. This reduces randomness and produces videos that feel intentional rather than stitched together."

      "title": "Use Case 1: Educators & Trainers",
      "content": "Trainers often struggle to convert concepts into engaging visuals. With Google Flow, an instructor can break a topic into 4–6 scenes (problem, tension, explanation, resolution) and generate a short explainer video that supports learning without complex editing tools."

      "content": "Marketing teams can test multiple creative directions rapidly. By keeping the same message but changing scene mood, lighting, or pacing, teams can explore which narrative resonates best before committing to high-cost production."
